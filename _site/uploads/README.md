# Adding media to the uploads folder
Please keep the upload folder clean and follow the folder structure.

- Use the `post_media` and `prj_media` folder for blog posts and projects accordingly.
- If your post / project contains more than a few pictures, better put them into a separate folder.
- Ideally, prefix your pictures with a descriptive name (eg. `farmbot_xxx.jpg`)
